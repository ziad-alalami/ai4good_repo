## Getting Started

Before contributing, please:
1. Read the [README.md](README.md) for project overview  
2. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates  
3. Open an issue to discuss major changes before implementing them  

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher  
- pip (for installing uv)  
- espeak-ng (required by phonemizer)  
- OpenAI API key  

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ziad-alalami/ai4good_repo.git
   cd ai4good_repo
   ```

2. **Install uv package manager**  
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**  
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

5. **Create required directories**  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data/audio
   mkdir -p data/background/user_responses
   mkdir -p data/agent_convo
   mkdir -p data/models
   ```

For detailed setup instructions, see the Quick Start Guide.

## Code Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines  
- Use meaningful variable and function names  
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes  
- Keep functions focused and concise  

### Dependencies
- Add new dependencies using:
  ```bash
  uv add <package_name>
  ```
- Document why new dependencies are needed in your PR  
- Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies  

### File Organization
- Place utility functions in `utils/`  
- Keep model-related code in `model/`  
- Store data files in appropriate `data/` subdirectories  
- Update `.env.example` if adding new environment variables  

---

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming
Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/description` - for new features  
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes  
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates  
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring  

### Commit Messages
Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
<type>: <short summary>

<optional detailed description>

<optional footer>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`  

Example:

```
feat: add phoneme analysis to BERT classifier

Implemented phoneme extraction using phonemizer library  
to improve speech assessment accuracy.

Closes #42
```

---

## Testing

### Running the Application
```bash
uv run python app/app.py
```
for the frontend and (in another terminal)
```bash
cd frontend/my-react-app
```
followed by
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Testing API Endpoints
Test endpoints manually or using tools like curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/questions
```

Before submitting:
- Ensure the Flask server starts without errors  
- Test all modified endpoints  
- Verify environment variables are properly documented  
- Check that new features work with existing data structures
